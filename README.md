# blutilityAutomationTool
A tool for exposing UProperty's to blueprints for the ability to batch process assets.


You need to have enabled editor scripting utilities in Plug-ins and Blutility in project settings.  Once those are enabled, you can then open the BPU_batchProcess(by right clicking and selecting edit blueprint) and set up a batch processing tool to change or replace any data on a UProperty.  The pins on the changeParameter will show in a pop up window when you select to run the script on an asset.  Those values can then be set in the window and you can press run to run the blueprint you set up.
